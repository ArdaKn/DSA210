# DSA210 Term Project: Does Gas Price Affect Public Transport Usage?

---

## 🏙️ Introduction

With fluctuating fuel prices, many urban residents reconsider their mode of transportation, shifting between private vehicles and public transport. This project investigates the relationship between **gasoline prices** and **public transport usage** in **Istanbul**, one of the world's most traffic-dense megacities.

The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for **city planners**, **economists**, and **policy-makers** to better understand mobility trends and optimize infrastructure decisions.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Fuel costs are a fundamental factor in transportation decisions. As prices increase, the use of public transportation may rise as a cost-saving measure. This behavioral shift is not just anecdotal—numerous studies (e.g., Litman, 2022; OECD Transport Reports) suggest strong economic influences on modal choice.

However, most research is conducted on national or international levels. This project offers a **localized Istanbul-based analysis** to fill the research gap and support data-driven urban policy. For example, if strong correlations are found, the city could proactively adjust transit capacities in response to fuel price volatility.

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing and Enrichment

- Public transport data was aggregated from **daily** counts into **monthly** total passenger counts.
- **Per capita ridership** was calculated by dividing monthly total passengers by Istanbul's estimated population for 2022 (~15,840,900).
- Gasoline price data was enriched by calculating the **monthly percent change** to capture sensitivity to price increases.

## 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Line plots to visualize long-term trends in fuel prices and ridership
- Correlation matrix heatmaps
- Scatter plots for direct visual relationship analysis

## 📊 Additional Variable: Weather Impact

### Why Include Weather?

Weather conditions can significantly affect daily transport behavior. For instance:
- **Hot or extremely cold months** may reduce walking and encourage public transport use.
- **Heavy rainfall** increases reliance on covered or underground transit (e.g., metro, tram), reducing bike or pedestrian activity.
- Urban planners often use **weather-based demand forecasting** to optimize operations and scheduling.

By enriching the dataset with **monthly average temperature** and **total precipitation**, this project explores whether **climatic factors influence ridership trends**, independently or in conjunction with fuel price fluctuations.

### Weather Data Integration

- The dataset was merged using the `"month"` column as a key across all sources (gasoline prices, ridership, and weather).
- Two new variables were introduced:
  - `avg_temp` — Monthly average temperature (°C)
  - `total_precip` — Monthly total precipitation (mm)
- Correlations were computed between ridership and weather variables to understand behavioral effects.

### Preliminary Weather Insights

| Variable         | Correlation with Ridership | Interpretation                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Average Temp     | Negative                   | Warmer months showed slightly lower ridership   |
| Total Precip     | Positive                   | Rainy months increased public transport use     |

These insights suggest weather plays a **secondary but noteworthy role** in shaping transportation behavior. Including weather data enhances the model's realism and opens new directions for multivariable forecasting.

## 📈 Hypothesis Testing

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** No significant relationship between gasoline price fluctuations and public transport usage.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** Gasoline price increases lead to higher public transport usage.

Tests Applied:
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** for linear relationships
- **Spearman Rank Correlation** for monotonic relationships

### Hypothesis Testing Results

- **Pearson correlation coefficient:** `r = 0.617`, **p-value = 0.0327**  
- **Spearman correlation coefficient:** `r = 0.573`, **p-value = 0.0513**

**Interpretation:**
- For Pearson correlation, at a 5% significance level, we **reject the null hypothesis**: there is a significant positive linear relationship between gasoline prices and public transport usage.
- For Spearman correlation, the p-value slightly exceeds 0.05, suggesting weaker but still notable evidence for a monotonic relationship.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model Results

To quantify the predictive power of external factors, a **linear regression model** was trained using:

- **Gas Price (TRY)**
- **Average Temperature (°C)**
- **Total Precipitation (mm)**

as independent variables to predict **per capita ridership**.

The model achieved an **R² score of 0.628**, indicating that approximately **63% of the variation in public transport ridership** can be explained by these three features.

- The **gas price coefficient was positive** (`+0.234`), supporting the hypothesis that higher fuel prices lead to increased public transport usage.
- **Temperature** (`-0.019`) and **precipitation** (`-0.243`) both showed small to moderate **negative effects**, potentially reflecting reduced ridership during hotter or rainier months.

Although the dataset size was limited to 12 monthly observations, the results provide a promising foundation for future multivariate modeling and time-series forecasting using a broader dataset.

## 📌 Findings

- Positive relationship between fuel price increases and public transportation ridership rates.
- **Metro** and **ferry** modes showed stronger responsiveness compared to buses.
- National holidays and COVID-19 lockdowns created visible anomalies (sharp dips).
